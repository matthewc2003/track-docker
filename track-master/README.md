### Usage

The bot can be launched with `bot/run.py`. The full usage is:

```
python run.py [--sync | --no-sync]
```

The optional sync flag will cause the bot to sync the command tree on startup. 
Only use this flag when necessary to avoid being rate-limited.

Render workers can be launched with `bot/worker.py`. The full usage is:

```
python worker.py -q {single, dual} [{single,dual} ...]
```

Which queues the worker should listen to can be specified with the respective option.

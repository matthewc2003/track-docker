## Transformers

---

The transformers for clans, players, and ships pass an id/index when selecting an autocomplete result.

However, you can also pass these yourself. For example, the following are all valid:

- `/clan clan: 1000062168 region: na`
- `/stats player: 1035252322 region: na`
- `/inspect ship: PFSD110`

For the majority of users, this is useless information, but it may prove useful to developers.
